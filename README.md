# CodeWars

## Welcome to my Codewars Repository! 
**Here I've listed all my solutions to the katas I've attempted.**

I've chosen to create this repository to be able to look back on my progress as a developer and see my progression over time. 

* Each folder contains problems found under that kyu rank
* Each file is a kata and will contain a link to the kata on codewars
